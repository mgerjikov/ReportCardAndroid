# ReportCardAndroid

<p><b> ReportCard - project from Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program in Udacity </b></p>

The goal is to design and create the structure of a <b>ReportCard Java Class</b> which would allow a school to store a student’s grades for a particular year. This project will be just a java class, rather than a full Android app.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

 - Designing a custom class
 - Creating that class in Java code.
 - Storing information in an array
 - Looping through an array

 #  PROJECT SPECIFICATION ReportCard 
 
 <p><b> CRITERIA / MEETS SPECIFICATIONS </b></p>
 
 <p><b>Class Design</b></p>
 
<p><b>Constants</b> / Any constants contained in the class are never modified, and are logical choices for constant values.</p>

<p><b>Submission Structure</b> / The submitted project consists of a single .java file, titled ReportCard.java, contained in a .zip file.</p>

<p><b>Variables</b> / The class contains appropriate variables to track information which belongs on a report card. The class does not contain variables which should belong, for instance, to a student, a teacher, a school, or a textbook.</p>

<p><b>Constructor</b> / The class contains at least one constructor which properly instantiates each variable in the class.</p>

<p><b>Getters</b> / Any private variables which might be read off of a report card should have a getter method to access them.</p>

<p><b>Setters</b> / All private variables require a setter method.</p>

<p><b>The toString() method</b> / The class contains a toString() method which returns the contents of the class in a human-readable string. The toString() method should properly use the @Override notation.</p>

<p><b>Functionality</b></p>

<p><b>Compilation Errors</b> / The code compiles without errors</p>

<p><b>Code Readability</b></p>

<p><b>Format</b> / The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code.The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.</p>

<p><b>Naming conventions</b> / All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.</p>
